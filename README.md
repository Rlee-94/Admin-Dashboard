- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.

## Summary
This was an interesting project for me. I found that I definitely prefer to use GRID for a website layout. It was easy to align everything where I needed it to be and I was able use dev tools
to see exactly where I was messing up my GRID lines. The trickiest part of this project was combining Flex and grid together. I realized that there were sections, like the header that needed to be split into two columns, but also needed flex to align the content.

This was my first experience with SVGs. I found that creating a folder within the project for all of the SVG icons was the easiest solution for me. I'm sure there may be an easier way, however I linked each SVG to the appropraite section using an <img> tag. I did research and found that I was able to change the fill and width/height of the SVG images and that definitely helped with the styling of the webpage.

Overall, I felt that it was a challenging project, but definitely helped me learn a lot about GRID and flex. I hope to come back to this and add responsiveness and javascript later down the road. 

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of **HTML** ans **CSS** foundations.
- Practiced aligning and containing a webpage using *GRID** and **flex**
- Utilized StackOverflow to help align items within containers and styling SVG icons. 
- I used [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) for all of the SVG icons and will definitely come back here in the future.
